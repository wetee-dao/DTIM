## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview
In recent years, with the rapid development of information technology and technology, people's work mode has gradually changed from centralized work to decentralized work. Besides, the spread and prevalence of COVID-19 in recent years get people know the importance of diverse work modes. With this trend, the concept web3 steps out from its previous version web2. 

Currently, most Web3 companies are still working with tools within Web2, such as Telegram, Discord, Google Drive, Enterprise WeChat, DingTalk, Lark, and etc, Which user's information and initiative are limited. 

**DAO-entrance** is trying to create a safe, efficient, powerful and Web3-based instant collaboration tool, which is a breakthrough. It establishes solid trust relationship among organization members through open and transparent smart contract; it maintain end-to-end encrypted communication, to ensure efficient and confidentiallity; it improves work efficiency with thousands of open-source collaborative tool libraries; it keeps data in safe hands through distributed and decentralized storage. 

**DAO-entrance** focuses on providing DAO with a comprehensive collaborative tool. The tool will help DAO to set up a core team. After the core team authorized by the community, they can make decisions on the daily affairs of DAO, in order to avoiding endless voting. 

### Project Details

Our long-term goal is to provide a safe, private, efficient and automated DAO tool for enterprises, blockchains and web3 practitioners, in a multi-stage style in different period, and, in the meantime, to offer communication, consensus, production, settlement and other basic needs of members. 

Currently, we provide not only "ink!"-based DAO smart contract templates, but also  substrate-based pallet templates, which support instant integration of all substrate-based blockchains. By compatible with existing DAOs through a non-instrusive way, it allows enterprises and organization to create their own DAOs in a more convenient way. 

At this stage, **DAO-entrance** will provide a slack-like client which is based on the matrix protocol for instant messaging. Users can log in with a blockchain account. This tool is designed for modern devices and is compatible with devices equipped with Windows/mac/Linux/android/iOS, and provides organization members with a concise and convenient collaboration platform.

Through DAPP rendering engine which is based on flutter, **DAO-entrance** is compatible with most DAPPs and run at a faster speed. The core business would be materialized by flutter native applications, and DAPPs would be rendered by the dapp engine.

**DAO-entrance** Client is a non-intrusive client that supports layer1 blockchain and layer2 smart contracts, and it's dedicated to adapting DAO scenarios. As an initial stage, we build the **DAO-entrance** chain based on the substrate, and manage the **DAO-entrance** chain by using DAO. After continuous improvement of the Client, we  create **DAO-entrance** DAO, which is a fully autonomous and decentralized organization. Through our own requirements of **DAO-entrance** and continuous introduction of other work modes of DAO, we provide substrate pallet and "ink!" smart contracts with a fast DAO solution Polkadot Ecosystem.

According to business needs, DAO organizations will set up skill groups, called "guilds", and each guild will automatically create public chat channels and Kanbans in **DAO-entrance**. Users can join a guild based on their own strengths or willings.  Members can choose whether to participate in projects or events according to their own strengths and willingness. 

We provide DAO templates the substrate pallet and ink! Smart contracts:
1. RoadMap management.
2. Manage DAO share.
3. Management of core team and guild.
4. Workflow management (board/task).
5. Financial management.
6. Task bounty management.
7. Hot-swap voting management.
8. Contribution value and medal management.
9. Level management.
